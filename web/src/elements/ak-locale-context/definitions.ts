// NOTE: This table cannot be made any shorter, despite all the repetition of syntax. Bundlers look
// for the `import` #a *string target* for doing alias substitution, so putting
// the import in some sort of abstracting function doesn't work. The same is true for the `msg()`
// function, which `localize` uses to find strings for extraction and translation. Likewise,
// because this is a file-level table, the `msg()` must be thunked so that they're re-run when
// the user changes the locale.

// NOTE: The matchers try to conform loosely to [RFC
// 5646](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.txt), "Tags for the Identification of Languages." In
// practice, language tags have been seen using both hyphens and underscores, and the Chinese
// language uses both "regional" and "script" suffixes. The regexes use the language and any region
// or script.
//
// Chinese locales usually (but not always) use the script rather than region suffix. The default
// (optional) fallback for Chinese (zh) is "Chinese (simplified)", which is why it has that odd
// regex syntax at the end which means "match zh as long as it's not followed by a [:word:] token";
// Traditional script and the Taiwanese are attempted first, and if neither matches, anything
// beginning with that generic "zh" is mapped to "Chinese (simplified)."

// - Code for Lit/Locale
// - Regex for matching user-supplied locale.
// - Text Label
// - Locale loader.
